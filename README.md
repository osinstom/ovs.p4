# Introduction

This repository is a playground for adding the P4 support to Open vSwitch by leveraging uBPF VM,
P4 to uBPF compiler and integrating them with DPDK and AF_XDP interfaces.

**This project is a prototype, far from being mature.**

**Note!** This is my side project, which is based on my previous work around [P4rt-OVS](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/p4rt-ovs) and 
[the P4 to uBPF compiler](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/tree/master/backends/ubpf).
